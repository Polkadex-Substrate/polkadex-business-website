              Polkadex is the first project featuring an
              <strong> orderbook based exchange </strong>
              in the Polkadot ecosystem. Thanks to Polkadexâ€™s innovative
              interoperability layer,

              The Polkadex Main Network contains all Polkadex products,
              including Polkadex Orderbook. It also runs THEA, which means
              Polkadex will soon be connected to Ethereum (and other blockchains
              as determined by governance in the future).

              The Polkadex Main Network and the Polkadex parachain are two
              different networks.

              The Polkadex parachain will connect Polkadex to the Polkadot
              network and all its parachains and their respective assets.
            </p>

          <S.ChainCard>
            <p>
              The two networks will be joined by Thea Connector bridge (Parity
              technology) in the backend.

          <S.ChainCard>
            <p>
              The two networks are abstracted away in an easy-to-use interface
              which allows for the seamless transfer of tokens from connected
              parachains to Polkadex Orderbook and viceversa.
